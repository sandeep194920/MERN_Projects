- How to change state when a button is clicked
- How to use Emotion CSS for styling (https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
- We chose Emotion CSS this because MUI uses this as a key styling option. So in this project, we will learn how to use this emotion in isolation without MUI. This will help our future projects with MUI
- How to set linear colors for background by using backgroundImage prop
