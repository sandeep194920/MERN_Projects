# Project details

[Github Users]()

## Details

This project contains user registration and login functionality where user can register/login using username/password, OR throguh social accounts like Google, Facebook. Once the user logs in, he can search a github profile and get all the info about a profile like number of followers, languages, most cloned repos and so on. All the data could be represented using different charts like Bar Chart, Doughnut Chart and so on. We use `auth0` library for authenticaton.

## Flow of the app

Since this is a big app, we would note down the flow of the app.

#### Initial Pages we see when app starts (after setting up the starter project)

- We see 3 components on the `App.js` - Dashboard Page, Login Page and Error Page

![starter screen of App.js](./readmeImages/starter.png)

- The development idea is, we show the `Login` page (protected route) and when the user logs in then he can see `Dashboard` page. If he navigates to unknown route then the `Error` page is shown. So we put these 3 in App.js to begin with

---

#### Setup React Router 5

- In the App.js we setup the react router v5 basic routes
- We enclose everything in `BrowserRouter (as Router)`, and use `Switch` so the first matching route is rendered. to understand better about exact and Switch and their differences, refer the _Things we can learn_ or [Watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVtxC6CKzYU&ab_channel=kudvenkat)
- At this point our `App.js` looks like this

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" exact>
        <Dashboard></Dashboard>
      </Route>
      <Route path="/login">
        <Login />
      </Route>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

- We will add `Error` later

---

#### Let's add error

Now if the user navigates to the URL that doesn't exist then he will get a blank page. We need to avoid that using default route for `Error`

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" exact>
        <Dashboard></Dashboard>
      </Route>
      <Route path="/login">
        <Login />
      </Route>

      {/* Default route to show error page if none of the above routes match */}
      <Router path="*">
        <Error />
      </Router>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

---

#### Let's add Switch

Now, if we navigate to unknown URL the error page is displayed. But notice one thing, when you navigate to dashboard `/`, the error page is also shown along with Dashboard

![dashboard and error page without Switch in App.js](./readmeImages/dashboard%26error.png)

- This happens even though you have `exact` on `Dashboard`
- If we add `Switch` to all the routes, this would behave properly and show only Dashboard, so the code looks like this

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {/* Switch matches the first matching route. Note that * would be the second match to any route generally as it matches everything like /, /login, /about, /noroute and so on */}
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact>
          <Dashboard></Dashboard>
        </Route>
        <Route path="/login">
          <Login />
        </Route>

        {/* Default route to show error page if none of the above routes match */}
        <Router path="*">
          <Error />
        </Router>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

- I know it is confusing about the difference between `exact` and `Switch`, so I have explained the difference in detail in _Things we can learn section_ above
