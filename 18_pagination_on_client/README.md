# Project details

[Pagination on Client]()

## Details

We will generally have two flavours of pagination.

- client side pagination (shown in this project)
- server side pagination (we will see this in future projects)

We get github profiles in this project using github API. Since there are more profiles, it's a good user experience to paginate and show the results. If little results are shown on each page, then number of pages grow.

- If there are 100 results, and 10 are shown on each page then number of pages are 10.
- If there are 100 results, and 5 are shown on each page then number of pages are 20.
