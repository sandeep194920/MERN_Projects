### How to download and install a font to your mac

I inspected stripe and saw they are using `Sohne-war`. I downloaded that fonts through some website and it downloaded a zip. I unzipped it and had `.otf` files.

I navigated to `sandeepamaranth/Library/Fonts` and pasted these `.otf` files in there.

You should then see these fonts in font book on mac. To access font book, `cmd+space` and search for Font Book, and you will see the font here.

### How to add `Gradient animation background`

I initially used [Code Sandbox Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/canvas-gradient-forked-yit2qt?file=/src/CanvasGradient.js) to generate animated gradient background,

but then I found another closely matching gradient generator so I used [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/bxnsx?file=/src/App.js:0-617)
